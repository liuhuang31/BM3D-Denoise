## BM3D-Denoise
Using BM3D to denoise.

#### Platform:
my platform is win7+python3.5; Other python environments are easy to run.

#### To run this code:
* Enter the BM3D.py, change the 'img_name' param to you own image path. Then run the BM3D.py. That's ok.
  	
* For windows platform, you should also install some Python Extension Packages: numpy and opencv.
  	If you operating system is 64bit, you can find the packages in http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
